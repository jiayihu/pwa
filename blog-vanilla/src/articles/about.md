Hi, I'm **Jiayi Hu** and I write **chronicle** posts about my journey as a young 26 y/o web developer.

I'm currently working remotely as Front-end Developer, Trainer and Consultant leveraging React, Angular and Redux. But I'm also keen on web standards like Web Components and other languages such as Haskell.

I enjoy spending time chatting in the Italian communities *“React Italia”, "Angular Italia" and “Frontenders Verona”* and I speak sometimes at public tech events on national/international level.

Also a fan of vanilla Javascript/CSS but I hate vanilla yogurt.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading novels, dystopian books, watching dramatic films and experimenting in the kitchen.
